Definitivo

It was a Monday morning, during winter. Danny woke up to a bad surprise that day. Somehow, one window of his house was open all night and some snow got in. It melted and now, all the kitchen floor is wet and it’s freezing cold. Danny is upset. Why was that window open? He doesn’t know how it happened, but he is mad because now he has to clean everything. Also, the carpet beside the door is completely ruined. He will have to buy a new one and honestly, he doesn’t have the budget for such expenses. Frustrated, Danny wiped the kitchen floor and closed the window, hoping it will never happen again.
